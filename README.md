## Introduction

<img align="center" src="docs/assets/logo.jpg" height="350">

This project was an idea that originated from MLH global hack week challenges. There was a challenge of creating a woodle clone in 15 minutes but I decided to bring a spin on it, what about creating a woodle clone with nextjs and React.
I looked for a woodle clone that was built with react and make migrations to nextjs. I used this project as my starting point [monsieurpunto/wordle-clone-reactjs](https://github.com/monsieurpunto/wordle-clone-reactjs.git) and made migrations to nextjs

## What it does
It's the normal woodle you know and love, but beefed up a lot.

## How we built it
Initially, I thought of being a purist but this presented an opportunity for me to learn more about react and nextjs. It gave me the opportunity to know the difference btwn pure react and nextjs.
## What we learned
I leant bootstrap and how amazing javascript world is.
